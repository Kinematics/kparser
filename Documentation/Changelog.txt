KParser Change Log

1.4.4 (November 4, 2009)
- Fix minor threading bug in Performance plugin.
+ Added ability set a display name for players.  With this, photoshopping screenshots should no longer be necessary.
~~ Usage: If player info text starts with text enclosed in square brackets (eg: [war/nin]), then that string will be used in place of the player's name if the option to do so is set in the Edit menu (and can thus be quickly toggled on and off).  An asterisk will be prepended to the text to indicate that it is user-defined.  Text more than 15 characters long will be truncated to avoid spacing issues compared to real names.
~~ Examples:  The war/nin (as used above) would thus have the name of "*war/nin".  Other players might be shown as "*Relic sam" or "*Spoony bard".
~~ This does not change the names listed in the player selection drop-downs on various tabs.  This also does not change the names listed in the Salvage subsection of the Loot tab.
~~ When the database structure is upgraded, this feature will move to its own field instead of being a fudge in part of the player info field.
* Changed Unparsed Data plugin to Raw Data plugin, with the option to either show only unparsed lines (what was shown before), or all lines logged.
~~  NOTE: Be aware that loading all raw data can take a long time for a large parse.  You should generally Not change the type while in the middle of a parse.


1.4.3 (November 2, 2009)
- Fix (?) issue regarding presence of SQLCE.
- Fix issue with needing administrative rights to run in Vista and Windows 7.
- Fix bug in parsing 'no effect' enfeebles.
- Fix bug in parsing use of Feather Tickle by blue mage mobs.
- Fix bug in parsing certain ability names.
- Fix bug in error logging.
- Fix bug in handling the Recent Files list.
* Compact long file names in the Recent Files list.  Added tooltips for full path.
+ Started to revise Damage/Minute plugin, ended up creating an entirely new one: Performance.  D/M will be deprecated.
~~ Note: the calculations to reach DPM (or DPS) are done differently in the two plugins, and probably will not match.  I believe the new version is more accurate.


1.4.2 (September 1, 2009)
+ Added Weaponskill/TP Rate plugin.


1.4.1 (August 31, 2009)
+ Added an installer project for KParser.  Zip file now contains the installer.
>> Installer will attempt to download and install prerequisites for you if they are not already instead (IE: .NET 3.5 and SQLCE 3.5).
* Converted all string literals in the program UI to resource elements, and set up the basis for allowing localization of the program into French, German and Japanese.
*** This is NOT an enablement of parsing foreign language versions of FFXI.  This is for the UI ONLY.  Parsing will be added at a future date.  The UI can be updated progressively with translations; parsing needs to be pretty much complete from the start to be useful.
+ Added a recent files menu.  Default is 4 items listed.  Can adjust options to list up to 10.
+ Added access to certain files from the About window.


1.4.0 (August 08, 2009)
* Update default memloc to 0x0057DA98.
* Changed SQLCE reference to explicitly use/require SQLCE 3.5/SP1.  Check the readme.txt file for where to find the intallation version if you need it.
* Reverted some of the RAM code from the last version since some of the information I thought was there was wrong.
* Modified RAM reading code to better track original raw data to avoid certain types of data corruption for people with, eg, JP locale OSes.
- Fix timestamps reported in the Chat tab.
- Fix timestamps reported in the Unparsed Data tab.
+ Add menu item to close all tabs.
* Clean up handling of tracking tabs.
- Fix bug of not properly tracking certain JA enfeebles.
+ Echo messages that start with "KP:" or "KParser:" (case insensitive) will be saved as chat messages of type 'echo'.  They will not be removed if you save a copy of the database without chat information.
* Adjusted window title to show currently open database file.  Status text info simplified.
* Revised custom mob selection dialog to use a list box instead of a checked list box.  Also shows the number of selected mobs now.


1.3.9 (May 28, 2009)
* Significant rewrite of RAM monitoring code for simplified detection and better handling of message tracking.
* Link detection and handling is added to the tabs' text boxes.  This means that if a URL shows up in the Chat tab (must start with http://), you can click on it to open the link in a browser window.
* Adjust parsing to allow 5-digit numbers, for instances of over 10,000 damage being done.
* Start adjusting code to better handle different OS locales.
- On Items tab, details view, times were not being converted to local timezone.  Corrected.
- Fix typo that caused counters to be listed as retaliations.
- Bug fix: The Thief plugin occasionally had a null reference when checking weaponskill usage.
- Bug fix: Self-cast AOE buffs weren't showing everyone who was affected by the spell in the Buffs tab.


1.3.8 (April 24, 2009)
* Update the default memloc after the patch on April 22.
- Fix issue where missed ranged attacks were not getting added to an associated battle properly.  This meant that all display filters other than 'All' always reported 100% ranged accuracy.  Older data will need to be reparsed to get correct values.


1.3.7 (April 8, 2009)
- Fix parsing of Violent Flourish's damage+stun effect.
- Damage+debuff effects (Violent Flourish, stun kukri, etc) should now get reported properly in the Debuff tab.
- Fix same bug as in 1.3.6 (eg: blindna failed to take effect) for alliance members as well as party members.
* Update memloc location for April 8 update.
+ Add Enfeebling plugin tab (experimental, and has known problems; suggest only using for research at this time).


1.3.6 (March 30, 2009)
- Bug fix: Failed enhancements (eg: blindna failed to take effect) were incorrectly parsed and ended up causing a false CharmedPlayer to show up in the logs, and thus in the fight lists.  Reparsing is necessary to get corrected data.
- Bug fix: Crash bug due to empty battle data when changing selected mob.
* Fights tab now shows fights where you received XP, but were not in range to see what was killed.
* Fights tab shows the chain number for each battle.
- Fix issues in creating new battle entries in situations where the mob was killed but not named (ie: outside of range of seeing what was killed).
- Fix issue of corrected base XP value (after removing chain multiplier) being applied to fights of chain 0.  The full spread of proper xp value should now show up.


1.3.5 (March 27, 2009)
- Fix annoying problem of losing preferences when updating the parser.  Old settings are now carried over when using a new version of the program.
- Fix multiple redraws when Group flag is changed.
* Custom mob filter shows fight number to match the dropdown listing.
- Dancer Steps and Flourishes are properly categorized as Enfeebles rather than ordinary damaging abilities.


1.3.4 (March 19, 2009)
- Fix bug in combo box selection/update with the DPM plugin.


1.3.3 (March 18, 2009)
+ Add new methodology to provide custom filtering of mobs for most plugins.


1.3.2.1 (March 16, 2009)
- Fix major bottleneck in message insertion in the database.  Should speed up back end processing by a factor of about 10.


1.3.2 (March 16, 2009)
- Fix bug that terminated long reparse sessions prematurely.
- Fix Thief plugin analysis code for better accuracy.


1.3.1 (March 16, 2009)
+ Add function to reparse older parses and update their timestamp information.
+ Fixed reparsing function to carry over user-edited player information.
- Using 'Save As' and trying to overwrite an existing file works now.


1.3.0 (March 16, 2009)
* Major refactoring of core elements for piping messages through the program.
* Rewrite of Offense and Defense tab accumulators.  Old accumulators had some issues, new ones should be significantly faster.
- Fix issue with charmed players not being reported properly.  General bug fix on resolving entity types.
- General bug fixing of architecture issues.



1.2.3 (Feb 21, 2009)
* Adjust name list and name parsing for more puppet names.


1.2.2 (Feb 15, 2009)
- Work around problem of the Windower Timestamp plugin causing chat text to get corrupted (and thus prevent parsing) if the user has Japanese as their primary system language.
- Misc bug fixes and cleanup.


1.2.1.1 (Feb 6, 2009)

- Fix finding successful HELM results that also had a tool break in Loot tab.
+ Added the date to the list of info shown on the Experience tab.
- Fix issue of full database updates being sent to plugins when they are expecting only change sets (causes issues in accumulations).



1.2.0 (Dec 30, 2008)
+ Implement testing framework.
+ Begin implementing unit tests.
- Fix bad chat text for moogle job change.
* Change which settings file the default save directory is stored in.
- Fix bug of the default parse always using the CommonApps directory instead of the specified default directory.
- Misc bug fixes uncovered by the testing framework.
* Show players in Player Info plugin even when no information has been entered for them.

- Fix misspelled "Frostbite" and "Freezebite" so that they show up as Weaponskills properly.
+ Add percentage of number of drops per mob to loot distribution reporting.
+ Add option to show loot groupings.

- Fix issues with mob filtering in the Thief plugin.
- Improved SATA damage lookup mechanism in Thief plugin.
+ Add new plugin for analyzing Extra Attacks (Double/Triple/Kick Attacks and multi-attack weapons).  Experimental.  Recommend only using it for post-parse analysis (a large parse can take 20 seconds to process); do not leave it open while parsing.  Best results from parses with minimal lag.
+ Add new plugin for Damage per Minute calculations.  Experimental.  Note that this shows damage -rates-, not necessarily actual damage done.


1.1.0 (Sept 14, 2008)
+ Allow setting default save directory.
 -- NOTE: The default directory in the Common Application Path now ends in 1.1.  Earlier version of KParser would have had a default path ending in 1.0.  Your existing parses should be in that sister directory.  You may move them to your preferred directory if you wish.
- Fix bug where buffs were not being credited to appropriate battles, preventing proper filtering.
 -- NOTE: To get this corrected in older parses, you'll need to run them through the Upgrade/Reparse mechanism.
- Fix so that Exclude 0 XP Mobs option in Offense tab works properly.  Extended this filter to all tabs.
+ Added mob filtering to Recovery tab.
* Adjust battle acredidation in the case of actions that occur immediately after a mob's death that may simply be out-of-order messaging.

---------------------------------------

1.0.13.1
- Fix issue of error on empty list in Thief plugin.


1.0.13
+ Add new weaponskill names.
- Bug fixes for Chat and OffenseDetails plugin.
- Adjust crit threshold calculation for Thief plugin.
+ Add solo weaponskill data to Thief plugin.


1.0.12
* Revamp of Thief plugin to fix various issues and better handling of locating SATA hits, plus expanded summary.
- Fix issue in Buffs plugin to deal with duplicate buff entries relating to self-buffs.  Rewrote so that all self-buffs were marked as Self, and not targetting <playername>.
* Updated memloc value.


1.0.11 (Sept 1, 2008)
- Fix issue where a Puppetmaster Overloading would reclassify the player as a mob, effectively removing them from further parse display.
- Fix parser to parse Hide events.
+ Add Thief plugin for tracking SATA/Hide damage.  Very expensive to process, so minimal set allowed during parsing.  Implemented at the request of Melphina.


1.0.10.1
- Fix crash bug in player info dialog.

 
1.0.10 (Aug 28, 2008)
+ Added ability to save a copy of the database stripped of all chat information (excluding arena/HELM messages) for privacy when sharing database files.
+ Implemented initial report function, allowing user to save current plugin text window to a text file.
+ Added option to allow specifying the particular POL process to monitor when parsing starts.
* Revamped handling of data in the Offense tab to improve speed (~40% load improvement, even more during parsing).  Will update other high-cost tabs in similar ways over time.
* Added melee and ranged Additional Effects and Spikes damage to details reports.


1.0.9 (Aug 27, 2008)
+ Added dialog to allow access to database field to store small bits of info (100 characters of data) about combatants.  This field will probably be expanded when the database is next modified.
+ Addition of Offense and Defense detail/frequency plugins.  Note that these are processor-intensive when run on the full dataset, so the filtering is automatically set to single-battle only while parsing is active.
+ For Frequency plugins, a '+' denotes a mode value (occurs most frequently in sample set, may occur multiple times) and a '^' denotes a median value (frequency of occurances above and below the given sample is roughly equal).
* Plugin menu is sorted by name.
- Fixed issue of -ga spell damage not showing proper totals.


1.0.8 (Aug 22, 2008)
- Misc fixes for exception handling and null references for stability.
- Fix issues in Options dialog error handling.
+ Add additional Puppet weaponskills.
- Fix parsing of missed Puppet ranged attacks.
- Fix issue of parsing item use improperly.
+ Show failed spells in spell damage section.
* Better parsing of damage abilities vs debuffs.
- Fix so that broken synths don't show up in the loot tables as 'lost' items.
- Updated Debuff section to allow proper filtering by mob.
+ Added parsing of HELM/Choco diggin activities in the Loot plugin.

Thanks to Eryvinim for suggesting and putting together the basics of parsing mining from the chat log.  I've reimplimented it in the Loot plugin for all HELM activities.  The next time the database changes, I'll add in the function to parse HELM and synthing such that items are stored in the appropriate tables.
