KParser Change Log

1.1.6
* Adjusted output layout of Loot page.
+ Added option to filter mobs killed by certain players when counting killed mobs in Loot tab.
+ Added option to filter mobs killed by certain players when counting killed mobs in Experience tab.
- Fix retaliation mob filter check in Defense tab.
- Fix reporting of intimidation defense events in Defense tab.
- Disable Group Mobs option in Defense Details tab while a parse is active (the option is ignored while a parse is active anyway).


1.1.5
- Fix misspelled "Frostbite" and "Freezebite" so that they show up as Weaponskills properly.
+ Add percentage of number of drops per mob to loot distribution reporting.
+ Add option to show loot groupings.
* Adjust Thief SATA threshold.


1.1.4
+ New plugin: Items.  Shows details of items used, and when.
- Fix possible null reference when reading RAM.
- Fix possible invalid key reference when using a Dictionary in the Extra Attacks plugin.
+ Add framework for exporting data to Excel.


1.1.3
- Fix issue in parsing from log files where the same log file may be parsed multiple times.
+ If parsing from log files and the Windower Timestamp plugin is in use, KParser will now use that time to mark messages that get parsed for better database accuracy.
* Default first entry of mob list in DPM plugin is now "None".
* Consolidate smaller non-combat plugin DLLs into a single DLL.


1.1.2
- Make sure text windows are read-only.
- Fix issue with updates running twice when a parse is opened.
- Significant speed improvement fixes for the Buffs plugin.
- Significant speed improvement fixes for the Extra Attacks plugin.
* Major rewrite of the Extra Attacks plugin.


1.1.1
- Fix issues with mob filtering in the Thief plugin.
- Improved SATA damage lookup mechanism in Thief plugin.
+ Add new plugin for analyzing Extra Attacks (Double/Triple/Kick Attacks and multi-attack weapons).  Experimental.  Recommend only using it for post-parse analysis (a large parse can take 20 seconds to process); do not leave it open while parsing.  Best results from parses with minimal lag.
+ Add new plugin for Damage per Minute calculations.  Experimental.  Note that this shows damage -rates-, not necessarily actual damage done.


1.1.0
+ Allow setting default save directory.
 -- NOTE: The default directory in the Common Application Path now ends in 1.1.  Earlier version of KParser would have had a default path ending in 1.0.  Your existing parses should be in that sister directory.  You may move them to your preferred directory if you wish.
- Fix bug where buffs were not being credited to appropriate battles, preventing proper filtering.
 -- NOTE: To get this corrected in older parses, you'll need to run them through the Upgrade/Reparse mechanism.
- Fix so that Exclude 0 XP Mobs option in Offense tab works properly.  Extended this filter to all tabs.
+ Added mob filtering to Recovery tab.
* Adjust battle acredidation in the case of actions that occur immediately after a mob's death that may simply be out-of-order messaging.
* Rewrite of base class for plugins to somewhat simplify coding (though more work needed for customization of controls) and lend uniformity to code.
- Various display bugs fixed.


---------------------------------------

1.0.13.1
- Fix issue of error on empty list in Thief plugin.


1.0.13
+ Add new weaponskill names.
- Bug fixes for Chat and OffenseDetails plugin.
- Adjust crit threshold calculation for Thief plugin.
+ Add solo weaponskill data to Thief plugin.


1.0.12
* Revamp of Thief plugin to fix various issues and better handling of locating SATA hits, plus expanded summary.
- Fix issue in Buffs plugin to deal with duplicate buff entries relating to self-buffs.  Rewrote so that all self-buffs were marked as Self, and not targetting <playername>.
* Updated memloc value.


1.0.11
- Fix issue where a Puppetmaster Overloading would reclassify the player as a mob, effectively removing them from further parse display.
- Fix parser to parse Hide events.
+ Add Thief plugin for tracking SATA/Hide damage.  Very expensive to process, so minimal set allowed during parsing.  Implemented at the request of Melphina.


1.0.10.1
- Fix crash bug in player info dialog.

 
1.0.10
+ Added ability to save a copy of the database stripped of all chat information (excluding arena/HELM messages) for privacy when sharing database files.
+ Implemented initial report function, allowing user to save current plugin text window to a text file.
+ Added option to allow specifying the particular POL process to monitor when parsing starts.
* Revamped handling of data in the Offense tab to improve speed (~40% load improvement, even more during parsing).  Will update other high-cost tabs in similar ways over time.
* Added melee and ranged Additional Effects and Spikes damage to details reports.


1.0.9
+ Added dialog to allow access to database field to store small bits of info (100 characters of data) about combatants.  This field will probably be expanded when the database is next modified.
+ Addition of Offense and Defense detail/frequency plugins.  Note that these are processor-intensive when run on the full dataset, so the filtering is automatically set to single-battle only while parsing is active.
+ For Frequency plugins, a '+' denotes a mode value (occurs most frequently in sample set, may occur multiple times) and a '^' denotes a median value (frequency of occurances above and below the given sample is roughly equal).
* Plugin menu is sorted by name.
- Fixed issue of -ga spell damage not showing proper totals.


1.0.8
- Misc fixes for exception handling and null references for stability.
- Fix issues in Options dialog error handling.
+ Add additional Puppet weaponskills.
- Fix parsing of missed Puppet ranged attacks.
- Fix issue of parsing item use improperly.
+ Show failed spells in spell damage section.
* Better parsing of damage abilities vs debuffs.
- Fix so that broken synths don't show up in the loot tables as 'lost' items.
- Updated Debuff section to allow proper filtering by mob.
+ Added parsing of HELM/Choco diggin activities in the Loot plugin.

Thanks to Eryvinim for suggesting and putting together the basics of parsing mining from the chat log.  I've reimplimented it in the Loot plugin for all HELM activities.  The next time the database changes, I'll add in the function to parse HELM and synthing such that items are stored in the appropriate tables.
