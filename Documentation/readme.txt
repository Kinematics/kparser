System Requirements:

OS:
Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, or 7; 32-bit or 64-bit.
Program may run on Windows 2000, but is not directly supported.


Support Services:
Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1
This may be installed via Windows Update or downloaded directly
from Microsoft's website at:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=ab99342f-5d1a-413d-8319-81da479ab0d7&displaylang=en

KParser's installer should try to automatically install the
.NET Framework if it is not already present on your computer.


Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition 3.5 SP1 (SQLCE 3.5sp1)
This may be downloaded directly from Microsoft's website at:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=DC614AEE-7E1C-4881-9C32-3A6CE53384D9&displaylang=en

If you are running a 32 bit OS (eg: Windows XP, Windows 7 32-bit, etc)
then get the x86 install (SSCERuntime-ENU-x86.msi).

If you are running a 64 bit OS (eg: Windows Vista x64, Windows 7 64-bit, etc),
then you need to install both the x86 portion (SSCERuntime-ENU-x86.msi) and
the x64 portion (SSCERuntime-ENU-x64.msi).

KParser's installer should try to automatically install
SQLCE if it is not already present on your computer.



Troubleshooting:

If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7 you may need to adjust the runtime
permisssions for the program if you wish to make use of the RAM monitoring methodology
of the parser.

Right click on the .exe file (or desktop shortcut) and select Properties.
Go to the Compatibility tab and check the check box "Run this program as an Administrator".

If you are running 64-bit Windows Vista you may need to install the patch
from this page in order to fix some problems with .NET 3.5:

It is uncertain if this patch is already included in 3.5 SP1.
