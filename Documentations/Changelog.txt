KParser Change Log

1.0.9
+ Added dialog to allow access to database field to store small bits of info (100 characters of data) about combatants.  This field will probably be expanded when the database is next modified.
+ Addition of Offense and Defense detail/frequency plugins.  Note that these are processor-intensive, and should not be open during normal parsing.
+ For Frequency plugins, a '+' denotes a mode value (occurs most frequently in sample set) and a '^' denotes a median value (frequency of occurances above and below the given sample is roughly equal).
* Plugin menu is sorted by name.


1.0.8
- Misc fixes for exception handling and null references for stability.
- Fix issues in Options dialog error handling.
+ Add additional Puppet weaponskills.
- Fix parsing of missed Puppet ranged attacks.
- Fix issue of parsing item use improperly.
+ Show failed spells in spell damage section.
* Better parsing of damage abilities vs debuffs.
- Fix so that broken synths don't show up in the loot tables as 'lost' items.
- Updated Debuff section to allow proper filtering by mob.
+ Added parsing of HELM/Choco diggin activities in the Loot plugin.

Thanks to Eryvinim for suggesting and putting together the basics of parsing mining from the chat log.  I've reimplimented it in the Loot plugin for all HELM activities.  The next time the database changes, I'll add in the function to parse HELM and synthing such that items are stored in the appropriate tables.
