KParser Change Log

1.0.10.1
- Fix crash bug in player info dialog.

 
1.0.10
+ Added ability to save a copy of the database stripped of all chat information (excluding arena/HELM messages) for privacy when sharing database files.
+ Implemented initial report function, allowing user to save current plugin text window to a text file.
+ Added option to allow specifying the particular POL process to monitor when parsing starts.
* Revamped handling of data in the Offense tab to improve speed (~40% load improvement, even more during parsing).  Will update other high-cost tabs in similar ways over time.
* Added melee and ranged Additional Effects and Spikes damage to details reports.


1.0.9
+ Added dialog to allow access to database field to store small bits of info (100 characters of data) about combatants.  This field will probably be expanded when the database is next modified.
+ Addition of Offense and Defense detail/frequency plugins.  Note that these are processor-intensive when run on the full dataset, so the filtering is automatically set to single-battle only while parsing is active.
+ For Frequency plugins, a '+' denotes a mode value (occurs most frequently in sample set, may occur multiple times) and a '^' denotes a median value (frequency of occurances above and below the given sample is roughly equal).
* Plugin menu is sorted by name.
- Fixed issue of -ga spell damage not showing proper totals.


1.0.8
- Misc fixes for exception handling and null references for stability.
- Fix issues in Options dialog error handling.
+ Add additional Puppet weaponskills.
- Fix parsing of missed Puppet ranged attacks.
- Fix issue of parsing item use improperly.
+ Show failed spells in spell damage section.
* Better parsing of damage abilities vs debuffs.
- Fix so that broken synths don't show up in the loot tables as 'lost' items.
- Updated Debuff section to allow proper filtering by mob.
+ Added parsing of HELM/Choco diggin activities in the Loot plugin.

Thanks to Eryvinim for suggesting and putting together the basics of parsing mining from the chat log.  I've reimplimented it in the Loot plugin for all HELM activities.  The next time the database changes, I'll add in the function to parse HELM and synthing such that items are stored in the appropriate tables.
